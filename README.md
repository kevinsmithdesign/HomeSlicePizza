# HomeSlicePizza

For this assignment, I'm building a website for Home Slice Pizza in ATX. The site will have a home page, about page, menu page, and contact page. I'm going to add an order page in the future that takes the information the user has entered and prints a receipt for the cook. The home page will have an image slider that shows five different images of the restaurants store front and menu items.
